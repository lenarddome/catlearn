* Block Types

There will be two block type: ones where uncertain compounds result in
P(o1) and another where they result in P(o2).

** DONE Experiment 1

Not going to do, as it is essentially a within-lab replication of LePelley
(2011), but keep in mind for future reference.
8 stim x 20 blocks
20x0.7=14 blocks with P(o1) and 20x0.3=7 with P(o2)

** TODO Experiment 2

4 stim x 24 blocks
24x(2/3)=*16* blocks with P(o1) and 24*(1/3)=*8* blocks with P(o2)

*** STAGE 2

6 training blocks x 4 stim

* Trial Order
Trials were randomized within blocks, but stimuli was not followed by itself
across blocks. If block ended in AX, the next block began stimuli other than
AX.
