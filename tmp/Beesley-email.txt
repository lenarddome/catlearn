Hi Andy - no worries, and thanks again for your earlier help. 

Lenard - please let me know if you have any queries. 

Best wishes,

Tom

Hi Tom,

Cool stuff! Alas, I am now on holiday, and then a conference, and hence not really around much until after Easter Monday. I'm cc'ing Lenard, who is the guy who has the Mack75 simulation we needed to check a published simulation against.

Lenard - Tom's kindly done this for us. If you have questions between now and Easter Monday, perhaps contact him directly? I can get back in the mix from then :-)

All the best

Andy

(i.e., procedure/analysis/figures), but you should be able to use this to 
verify your own simulation. You won't need it, but you can switch from RW to 
Mack using a parameter at the top.

This gives all trial details, for all simulated participants, recording 
trial-to-trail changes in associative strengths and alphas across the columns.

some thoughts...Here I choose to update associative strengths for the two 
outcomes that are presented. That is, if cues 1 and 2 are presented with 
outcomes 1 and 2, I update associative strengths for outcomes 1 and 2 
(the correct and incorrect outcome). I am therefore assuming full feedback - 
participants would know that outcome 2 is incorrect if outcome 1 was correct. 
However, when calculating alpha it is done only with respect to how good the 
cues were at predicting the correct outcome. I suppose these things could be 
interpreted differently.
